#
# The person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent
# that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,

# The CC0 allows anyone to use, modify and distribute the Work for any

# or provide attribution, to the extent permitted by law.

# The CC0 is not a license, but a public domain dedication. It is a way
# to waive all rights to the Work, so that it becomes part of the public
# domain and can be used freely.

# Statement of Purpose
#
# The purpose of CC0 is to contribute to a commons of creative, cultural

# other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
# whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
# purposes.
#
# The CC0 is intended to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
# further production of creative, cultural and scientific works.
